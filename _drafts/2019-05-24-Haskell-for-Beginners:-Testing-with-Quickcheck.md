title:  "Haskell for Beginners: Testing with Quickcheck
Welcome to my first post in a series on Haskell. In this series I will be covering a range of beginner topics; the series may continue to me covering more advanced topics. 

Every post will have an accompanying video posted on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTjuCgOkzoFPiF7iKlwlJDQ?view_as=subscriber).
