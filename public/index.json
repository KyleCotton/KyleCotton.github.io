Int / Integer refer to whole numbers the only difference is the bounds of the number, the maximum and minimum it can be, this is due to memory allocation. The Int supports integers in the range [-2^29 … 2^29-1], where as Integer is an arbitrary precision type, it can hold any number subject to the machines memory limitations. A Float holds a decimal value. A Char hold a single character. A String holds multiple characters, in actual fact the String data type is actually a Type Alias for [Char], a list of character, we will be using this fact later in this series. Finally Bool which is a Boolean value which is a logical result either True or False. As you discover Algebraic Data Types you will find that the above list is in fact essentially infinite, I will cover this topic in detail in a later post.

Open your favourite text editor, I like to use Emacs I will be making a series about Emacs soon. Create a file called basic_functions.hs all Haskell source code files will have the .hs file extension. Lets now define the square, cube and largest functions. We are using Haskell so Types Matter, although the Haskell Type System can infer types I always give a Type Signature for every function I define. square :: Int -\u003e Int Now its time for the actual function, what we need the function to do is get a value and return its square. Lets use the power operator (^). square :: Int -\u003e Int square x = x^2 That’s it, our first Haskell function, write the cube function then check your answer. cube :: Int -\u003e Int cube = (^3) Have you got the same? This is a new concept I have not introduced yet. This feature of Haskell is called Partial Function Application, its allows us to simplify the definition of functions, to essentially their logical/base components. Don’t you :heart: Haskell. The largest function behaves identically to the max function, so why not use that. largest :: Int -\u003e Int -\u003e Int largest = max The above is just example, in any other situation you might as well us the prelude function max and avoid unnecessary definitions Its time to test our new functions, open your favourite terminal emulator, move to the directory where the Haskell source code file is stored and enter ghci basic_functions.hs, this will load the file in to the Glasgow Haskell Compiler Interactive. Now from the GHCI prompt, enter cube 4 you should see the result 64 displayed directly in the terminal windows Enter square 9 you should see the result 81.

Due to the Type System, all list can only contain elements of the same type. Haskell also allows for infinite lists. An example of this can be seen below, I have extended the definition above to include all the even numbers - cool right! However, when we use infinite lists we have to ensure that we write robust code, so that we know our programs will eventually terminate. This will become even more important when we talk about recursion. evenList :: [Int] evenList = [0,2..] ## Basic List Operations Now we know about the list, lets look into some basic functions that can be applied to a list. This list shows us some of the most common functions, that are typically used with a List Comprehension product - returns the product of all the numbers in a list sum - returns the sum of all the numbers in a list and - applied a logic ‘and’ to the values in a list and returns the result or - applied a logic ‘or’ to the values in a list and returns the result !! - the infix direct access operator, returns the element at the nth position of the list Plus a lot more. Check out Hoogle, for a list of functions. Now lets see some examples of how these functions are used. product [1,2,3,4,5] will return the value of 1*2*3*4*5 which is 120. sum [1,2,3,4,5] will return the value of 1+2+3+4+5 which is 15. and [True,True,False,False,True] will return the value of True \u0026\u0026 True \u0026\u0026 False \u0026\u0026 False \u0026\u0026 True which is False. Since there exists a False within the list. or [True,True,False,False,True] will return the value of True || True || False || False || True which is True. Since there exist a True within the list. [0,2..100] !! 10 will return the element of the list [0,2..10] that is in the 10th position. Warning , remember that list in Haskell and most programming languages are Zero Indexed, we start counting from zero not one.

I may introduce some more exciting functions as we go along. I will also take you through my thought process as I come up with a solution. Create a list comprehension that gives us all of the positive even numbers. So the answer needs to choose only the even numbers, so we will be needing a guard for even numbers. We will have to use the even function. Lets find out more info about the even function. Open ghci as you have done previously Enter :info even this can also be shortened to :i even. Take note of the type, we give it an Integral which is either a Int or Integer and it returns a Bool This is exactly what we want, so lets use this handy function. We want all of the positive even numbers so we are going to have to use an infinite list. This is the generator. We don’t need to apply any function to the number that is added from the generator. So the final List Comprehension becomes the one below. [x | x \u003c- [0,2..], even x] Create a list of the first 100 perfect squares. When creating this list we can either, check if a number is a perfect square using a guard then add it, or create the perfect squares ourselves. I personally think the latter is easier. So we won’t be needing any guards for this solution. The generator should give us all of the first 100 integers so that we can make them into the perfect squares. We will need to apply a functions to each of the values, we need to square them. So the final List Comprehension becomes the one below. [x^2 | x\u003c-[1..100]] Find the product of the first 100 perfect squares This problem would be very complicated to solve without the aid of a computer. We will be composing a previous solution with one of the list functions we introduced earlier in this post. We already have list of the first 100 perfect squares, now we need to get the product of all of them. Lets get more info about the product function Lets open ghci Enter :i product Note the function takes a list of numbers and returns a single number This is exactly what we want, lets use the product function So the final List Comprehension becomes the one below. product [x^2 | x\u003c-[1..100]] Define a function that takes a String argument and returns a String containing only the letters of the input but now all lowercase. From one of my previous post I said a String is a Type Alias for [Char]. We are going to have to use this fact to answer this question. We have to only add characters that are letters so we are going to have to use a guard. Lets find out more info about the isLetter function. As previously use ghci to get more information about the function We can see that the function takes a Char and returns a Bool this is perfect for what we want We are given a string so that must form part of the generator Finally we must make all of the characters lowercase, so we must apply a function to each of them. Lets look at the toLower function Again use ghci to get more info We see that the function takes a Char and returns a Char this is what we want So the final list comprehension becomes f :: String -\u003e String f xs = [toLower x | x\u003c-xs, isLetter x] The above is a more complex example, lets go through the main parts of it again for clarity. For this problem we have defined a function f that takes a String as input and returns a String. The input string is the xs on the left hand side of the assignment operator =. We go through each element of xs which has type [Char], we call this element x. First we check if it is a letter, if False it is discarded, if True we apply the toLower function, making it lowercase then add it to the list to be returned.

Case: A condition that could happen, eg the number could be zero or it may not be. Lets kick off with an example of a recursive example then I’ll work through it with you.
